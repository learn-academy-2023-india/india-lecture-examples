### Vocab

- DOM - document object model, visual representation of the code
- Virtual DOM - layer that sits behind the DOM and listens for changes
- Node - HTML tag through the lens of the DOM
- DOM events - anything a user can do on the page, click, scroll, type, etc
- Event listeners - track those events, built into the DOM, we can use the listeners to create code tht responds to our user
